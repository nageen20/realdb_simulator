# 🧪 RealDB Playground

RealDB Playground is an open-source project to help learners, educators, and developers **simulate real-world OLTP databases** — complete with realistic schemas, fake yet meaningful data, and support for multiple database backends.

> Say goodbye to toy datasets with two tables — and hello to full, production-like relational systems you can practice on.

## 🚀 Features

- 🏗️ Choose from prebuilt **industry-style database schemas** (supply chain, eCommerce)
- 🤖 Generate **realistic synthetic data** using [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/)
- 🧠 Supports **column relationships**, foreign keys, and dependency-based data generation
- 🧾 Export to **CSV** or insert directly into **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**
- 🖼️ View **ER diagrams** and business context right in the UI
- 🎛️ Streamlit frontend to select schemas, view info, and simulate data
